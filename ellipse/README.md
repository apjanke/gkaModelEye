# ellipse

Routines for fitting ellipses. Several of these functions are taken from the "quadFit" MATLAB central toolbox created by Levente Hunyadi, "Estimation methods in the errors-in-variables context", PhD dissertation, submitted in 2013 to the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The original routines can be found here:

The functions taken from the quadFit toolbox are:

ellipsefit_robust.mellipsefit_distance.mellipsefit_direct.mellipseproj.m
ellipse_ex2im.mellipse_im2ex.m

Many of these routines have been slightly modified to speed execution and support code compilation.
