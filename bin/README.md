# bin
This directory holds compiled MEX function versions of `inverseRayTrace`.

If you need to compile the mex function for your system, issue the command `compileinverseRayTrace` in the MATLAB console.

The compiled function is placed by default in the directory that contains `compileinverseRayTrace`, which should be:
```
gkaModelEye/bin
```

Pre-compiled mex files are provided for some systems:

inverseRayTraceMex.mexmaci64	--	Mac OSX, MATLAB2017a and later
inverseRayTraceMex.mexa64	--	Ubuntu, MATLAB2018b and later
