# bin
This directory holds compiled MEX function versions of `virtualImageFunc`.

If you need to compile the mex function for your system, issue the command `compileVirtualImageFunc` in the MATLAB console.

The compiled function is placed by default in the directory that contains `compileVirtualImageFunc`, which should be:
```
gkaModelEye\bin
```
